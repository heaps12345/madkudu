# Want to be our first Customer Success Manager?

Companies like Amazon and Capital One build their own data-science tools to drive their businesses. Unfortunately few other businesses have $$ and expertise to do this. MadKudu is solving this problem by bringing the powers of data science to every business in the world.

You just might suspect that we're a group of turbo-nerds who spend our weekends reading about information theory and building software "for fun". Well ... yeah ... that pretty much describes us!

Which brings us to ... YOU!

If you're looking for your big break - an opportunity to build a world-class customer success team from scratch - this job is for you.

### Help us maximize each client’s potential for success

Like every fast-growing startup we have our strengths and weaknesses. To reach our short-term goal of $1M in ARR we need someone who can fill in the gaps.

Where we are:
- Our **product creates TONS of value** for our customers. We’re not a vitamin, we’re a pain killer. We have numerous [case studies](http://www.madkudu.com/customers-segment-fastlane) to prove it.
- We have a **very strong engineering team** who ships new features at blazing speed against a visionary roadmap.
- We have an **amazing group of customer advocates**. Today, We don’t do any marketing or outbound sales. Our new revenue come from recommendations from existing customers who saw the value of MadKudu.

Where we need your help now:
* Maximize each client’s potential for success by **becoming the trusted advisor and the coach** they’re looking for.
* Build a customer success **machine that can onboard customers at scale**. For example, this means creating and testing a customer playbook, and soon, hiring, leading and growing new CS team members.

### Could this be your resume in 2021?
Startups are not for everyone. If you value fancy desks and a predictable work schedule you won't be happy here.

But if you've been looking for your big break this could be the job for you. Do you want your resume to say the following in 5 years?

> Founding team member and first CSM at MadKudu. Helped company build the customer organization that  took the company from a handful of customers to $65M in revenue in 5 years.

Better still, do you want to look back on your time at MadKudu as a special experience where you worked with other passionate people? Where you helped create a unique corporate culture? Where you hired A people and turned them into A+++ people?
