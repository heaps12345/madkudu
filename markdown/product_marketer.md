# Want to be MadKudu's Product Marketer?

Companies like Amazon and Capital One build their own data-science tools to drive their businesses. Unfortunately few other businesses have $$ and expertise to do this. MadKudu is solving this problem by bringing the powers of data science to every business in the world.

# Is this job for you?

"Marketing" is a pretty general term - even among startups. Here are a few questions to help you decide if this is the right job for you.

### Are you a "product person"?

We have early customers and revenue but are not yet in growth mode. Before we try to drive growth we need to align our product features and message with our go-to-market. You will need to help us figure this out.

### Do you want to be at the ground level?

This is an opportunity to work through the major business challenges facing any startup. You'll have the support of an experienced co-workers and amazing customers but most of the strategic decisions are ahead of us.

You'll play a key role in finding the answers.

### Can you do strategic & hands-on work?

All of us - especially our CEO - contribute as an individual. If you want to manage a team on day 1 you won't enjoy working here.

Current hands-on skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, or design are a big, big plus. You'll need to find, hire, and manage any resources for skills you don't have.

### Can you write B2B marketing copy?

Although we're all fluent in English, it is not our first language. We need help writing blog posts, landing pages, ebooks, email courses, case studies, support documents - pretty much everything a B2B SaaS company needs to get traction.

### Do you understand SaaS business metrics? Data science?

To grow our business we need to win the trust of SaaS marketing departments. You need to be able to explain the value of MadKudu using a language these customers understand: conversion rates, segmentation, trial periods, etc. For instance, do you understand [this blog post](http://www.madkudu.com/blog/50-of-saas-conversions-happen-after-trial-ends/) and why it is important to SaaS marketers?

Additionally you need to understand basic data science concepts and how predictive analytics works. No, you don't need to know what "entropy" means or how it is different from a canopy. But you do need to understand enough data science to be able to write and communicate about it. Do you understand [this blog post](http://www.madkudu.com/blog/use-predictive-analytics-to-reduce-churn-by-20-in-2-days-with-3rd-grade-math/)? Could you explain it to someone?

You don't need to be an expert - just have the interest and aptitude to learn more about these ideas and the ability to put them into terms our customers understand.

### Are you ok with making mistakes?
We hope so - because we fully expect you to make them. If you're not making mistakes you're probably not pushing hard enough.

### Can you ... (fill in the blank)?
We are a startup. As the first marketing hire you have the opportunity to define your own job decide what is most important for the company to do to hit our goals. Of course we expect that you will take advantage of your own experience and skills in doing so.

Think we can get to our goals faster with a PR/media strategy? Love design and think our product would sell better if it was more beautiful? Want to start testing growth channels?

If you can demonstrate that your efforts will help us achieve our goals we're behind you 110%.

## Where? How much?
We're located in Mountain View, CA but you don't have to be. If you have experience working remotely, let's talk!

Competitive salary and early employee equity. 100% paid healthcare and dental coverage for you and your dependents.

## Could this be your resume in 2021?
Startups are not for everyone. If you value fancy desks and a predictable work schedule you won't be happy here.

But if you've been looking for your big break this could be the job for you. Do you want your resume to say the following in 5 years?

> Founding team member and first marketing hire at MadKudu. Helped company achieve product-market fit by aligning product messaging and features with market needs. Built and executed on the go-to-market strategy that took the company from a handful of customers to $65M in revenue in 5 years.

Better still, do you want to look back on your time at MadKudu as a special experience where you worked with other passionate people? Where you helped create a unique corporate culture? Where you hired A people and turned them into A+++ people?

If so we hope you'll [click here and apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l8Zt2AYpWklEcffrpspdgXqh5FadrXz2C7yvAQ9BCso/viewform).
