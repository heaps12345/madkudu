At MadKudu, our mission is to make predictive analytics available to everyone. We believe that data science and machine learning will change all businesses, not just the ones who can afford it today. We are obsessed about using data to simplify complex decisions and automate tedious processes.

### An awesome team

We're a small and tightly-knit founding team. We've spent years together building data systems and product teams. Everyone has several years of software engineering and machine learning experience. We love building together and are looking for exceptional people to build with us.

We participated in [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com') in the summer of 2015 and raised a **$1.4M seed round** in 2015 from awesome investors.

We've added a dozen new customers since the beginning of the year. Early customers are loving the product and referring us to their friends. We believe we're on to something big and are looking for amazing people to grow even faster.

### Culture

As a small company, we live (and die) by our culture. At MadKudu, we are:

* **[Honey badgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg)**
* Obsessed with **people's potential**. We're obsessed with learning and consistently improving. We strive to help each team member achieve their full potential and build their dream job.
* **Deliberate**: We believe that deliberate practice is what makes you a world-class performer and make time for it. We also believe that deliberate hypotheses and experimentation are the fasted way to learn. In other words, you can do everything, as long as you have a hypothesis about why you're doing it.
* **In it for the long haul**: We keep a work/life/family balance by working smarter instead of longer. We focus on output rather than the number of hours you spend at the office.
