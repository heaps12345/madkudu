## Our mission is to make data science available to EVERY business.

Data, data data. Businesses are drowning in data and need smarter solutions using predictive analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to make sense of it all.

Of course some big companies (like banks or telcos) have been successfully using these tools to manage their data for years. They can afford to hire teams of engineers and data scientists to build and manage complex systems. **We're on a mission to empower the remaining 99.9999% of the world's businesses with the same tools at a fraction of the cost.**

We help our customers use data to make critical business decisions - everything from "who should a sales rep call right now?" to "where should the CEO invest next year's marketing budget?".

## We're funded and have real customers

Missions are wonderful but startups come down to good execution - and that's where we're different.

### We have real results

MadKudu isn't an idea - it is a real business with real customers. Here is some data (we know you like data!).

As of April 1, 2016:

+ We have world-class customers you've heard of like [Segment](https://segment.com/), [Codeship](https://codeship.com/), and [Contactually](https://www.contactually.com/).
+ We're growing annual revenue **by 50% every month**.
+ We manage more than **10 million** user profiles for our customers
+ We process more than **500 million events every day**.

### We're a Techstars company

We're proud to have been part of [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com) Boulder 2015. The network is amazing and still tremendously helpful. We're also taking to heart their advice about [making our work awesome, day after day](http://www.techstars.com/content/blog/19687/).

### We're funded and on track for growth

Even in this tough funding environment MadKudu was able to **raise a $1.4M seed round** from world-class investors.

We're also hitting our milestones and on track to raise our next round of funding - in fact, investors are contacting us.

### We prove our value and become "a no-brainer" for customers

We recently **generated more than $300K in annual revenue** for one a customer - about 10x what we charge them.

That customer told us *"with results like this, buying MadKudu is a no-brainer"*.

## We ~~talk about~~ live our culture

Startups are insanely risky endeavors. We can do our jobs perfectly and still fail for reasons beyond our control.

For that reason we're determined to make MadKudu **a great experience for you regardless of our ultimate outcome**.

> "MadKudu is a rare combination of a world-class team pursuing a big market opportunity.
But what makes the company truly special is just how likable they are. From the moment I met these guys I just wanted them to succeed. Their customers obviously feel the same way."

> [Kevin Dewalt](https://angel.co/kevindewalt/), MadKudu investor.

### Join a team obsessed with "people potential"

MadKudu isn't a team of "lone wolves" - and that includes personal growth.

We help each other define our goals and achieve them through mutual accountability.

Have a personal goal? Exercise more? Meditate? Learn how to finally pronounce "th" correctly? Learn Python? We work together to help each other become better.

### Join a team that makes data-driven decisions

> "In God we trust, all others bring data."
-- [Edwards Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Quotations_and_concepts)

At MadKudu we make business decisions based on **what the data says - not what "the boss" says**. We strive to let the best arguments based on the best data win.

What is the best market? What feature should we build next? We start by looking at the data.

### You value work/life balance

We work hard but we're not workaholics. Building a great company takes years - years where you'll need your health, happiness, and a strong personal life.

Yes, you can work at a startup and have a life - in fact, we think this is the only way to do it. Our CEO Sam Levan himself has 4 amazing kids.

### Leave the office BS behind you

Only results matter. Not time in the office. Not hours worked. Not popularity. Not politics.

Just get results - in your way, at your pace. Do that and you'll have a blast here.
