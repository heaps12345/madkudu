# An Open Letter from Sam, Paul, and Francis

> “If You're Offered a Seat on a Rocket Ship You Don't Ask What Seat. You Just Get On.”
--Eric Schmidt, former CEO, Google

Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read about MadKudu.

Simply the fact that someone as talented as you would take an interest in learning about MadKudu has made our day.


Why are we so happy?

Because you have choices and could be working anywhere. Because you're one of the best at what you do and have extremely high standards. Because you're also fun to be around.

And you could be doing more - making a bigger impact, getting more satisfaction from work, learning from other A+ people. We'd like to tell you a little about MadKudu and why you want a seat on our Rocket Ship.

## Big mission? How about empowering EVERY business with data science

Data, data data. Every business in the world is drowning in data - so much that we can't possible understand it without the help of intelligent software like predictive analytics and machine learning.

Big businesses like credit card companies and banks have been building these type of systems for years. For example, your credit card company runs complex algorithms to predict whether that Leg Lamp you just bought is a legitimate or fraudulent charge.


### Our mission is to make data science available to EVERY business.

Big businesses like banks and phone companies can afford to hire teams of engineers and data scientists to build and manage these complex systems. We're on a mission to empower the remaining 99.9999% of the world's businesses with the same tools at a fraction of the cost.

Which customer is most valuable? Who should our sales reps call RIGHT NOW?

These are the questions you will help every business answer.

## We're funded and have real customers

Missions are wonderful but startups come down to good execution - and that's where we're different.

### Join an elite Techstars company

We're proud to have been part of Techstars Boulder 2015. Harvard accepts about 5% of applicants. Techstars accepts about 1%.

We continue to rely on the Techstars network for recruiting and business advice.

### Join a seed-funded company

Even in this incredibly tough funding environment MadKudu was able to raise a $1.4M seed round from some world-class investors.


### Join a company with real - paying - customers

MadKudu isn't an idea - it is a real business with real customers. To date we've processed over X Billion events for our early customers.

### Real results make us “A no-brainer”
We recently generated more than $300K in annual revenue for one of our customers - about 10x what we charge them.

That customer told us “with results like this buying MadKudu is a no-brainer”.

## Culture is easy to talk about - at MadKudu we live it

> “MadKudu is a rare combination of a world-class team pursuing a big market opportunity. But what makes the company truly special is just how likeable they are. From the moment I met these guys I just wanted them to succeed. Their customers obviously feel the same way.”
--Kevin Dewalt, MadKudu investor.

### Join a team obsessed with “people potential”

We think we're good - but we can be much, much better. We work together to help each other define and achieve our calls.

Have a personal goal? Exercise more? Meditate? Learn a new skill? We work together to help each other become better.

### Join a team that makes data-driven decisions

> "In God we trust; all others must bring data."
--Edwards Deming

At MadKudu we make business decisions based on what the data says - not what “the boss” says. We strive to let the best arguments based on the best data win.

What is the best market? What feature should we build next?

### You value work/life balance

We work hard but we're not workaholics. Building a great company takes years - years where you'll need your health, happiness, and a strong personal life.

Yes, you can work at a startup and have a life - in fact, we think this is the only way to do it.

### Leave the office BS behind you

Only results matter. Not time in the office. Not hours worked. Not popularity. Not politics.

Just get results - in your way, at your pace.
