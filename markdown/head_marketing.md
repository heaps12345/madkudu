# Want to be our Head of Marketing?

Companies like Amazon and Capital One build their own data-science tools to drive their businesses. Unfortunately few other businesses have $$ and expertise to do this. MadKudu is solving this problem by bringing the powers of data science to every business in the world.

[more about MadKudu](#)

You just might suspect that we're a group of turbo-nerds who spend our weekends reading about information theory and building software "for fun". Well ... yeah ... that pretty much describes us!

Which brings us to ... YOU! We're looking for our first full-time marketing hire to help us explain what we do and build the engine to drive scale. If you're looking for your big break - an opportunity to build a world-class marketing team from scratch - this job is for you.

## How you can help us get to $1M in annual revenue

Like every fast-growing startup we have our strengths and weaknesses. To reach our near-term goal of $1M in ARR we need someone who can fill in the gaps.

### Our current team is decent at
+ Direct sales. We're know what our customers need. When get qualified leads we know how to close them.
+ Software. We can turn customer needs into code quickly.
+ Service. We jump high before our customers even ask.

### Where we need your help
+ Product messaging. Explain what we do in landing pages, case studies, documentation, etc. in clear, simple ways our customers will understand.
+ Drive inbound leads. As a B2B company we need a steady stream of qualified leads to drive our growth.
+ Everything else. As our first marketing hire, you'll need help us identify and fill every marketing-related need.

#Is this job for you?

"Marketing" is a pretty general term - even among startups. Here are a few questions to help you decide if this is the right job for you.

### Do you like consistency?

We totally respect a desire for a predictable workplace - but if consistency is what you want you won't be happy here. We are a fast-paced Lean Startup and changing direction rapidly as we learn what our customers need. If you want to organize and plan a multi-month big marketing campaign with your favorite agency this isn't the job for you.

### Can you do strategic & hands-on work?

All of us - especially our CEO - contribute as an individual. If you want to manage a team on day 1 you won't enjoy working here.

You also need lead our marketing strategy. You will need to define and execute on marketing priorities based on what needs to be done.

Here's an example.

Suppose our landing page isn't converting enough the right type of customers. You need to be the person who notices this problem, figures out what the landing page should say, and makes it better. You can get resources (e.g. design or copy editing help) to do this but should be ready and willing to do a lot yourself.

### Can you write B2B marketing copy?
Although we're all fluent in English, it is not our first language. We need help writing blog posts, landing pages, ebooks, email courses, case studies, support documents - pretty much everything a B2B SaaS company needs to get traction.

We will want to see examples of blog posts or other marketing content you have written. We want to hear about your past direct sales/marketing campaigns. We want to hear your constructive feedback on our existing content.

We don't care how many years experience you have - just that you enjoy writing and can do it. A lot of it.

### Do you understand SaaS business metrics? Data science?

To grow our business we need to win the trust of SaaS marketing departments. You need to be able to explain the value of MadKudu using a language these customers understand: conversion rates, segmentation, trial periods, etc. For instance, do you understand [this blog post](http://www.madkudu.com/blog/50-of-saas-conversions-happen-after-trial-ends/) and why it is important to SaaS marketers?

Additionally you need to understand basic data science concepts and how predictive analytics works. No, you don't need to know what "entropy" means or how it is different from a canopy. But you do need to understand enough data science to be able to write and communicate about it. Do you understand [this blog post](http://www.madkudu.com/blog/use-predictive-analytics-to-reduce-churn-by-20-in-2-days-with-3rd-grade-math/)? Could you explain it to someone?

You don't need to be an expert - just have the interest and aptitude to learn more about these ideas and the ability to put them into terms our customers understand.

### Are you ok with making mistakes?
We hope so - because we fully expect you to make them. If you're not making mistakes you're probably not pushing hard enough.

### Can you ... (fill in the blank)?
We are a startup. As the first marketing hire you have the opportunity to define your own job decide what is most important for the company to do to hit our goals. Of course we expect that you will take advantage of your own experience and skills in doing so.

Think we can get to our goals faster with a PR/media strategy? Love design and think our product would sell better if it was more beautiful? Think you have a growth hack to help us generate qualified leads? Think SEM will generate qualified leads faster than writing content?

If you can demonstrate that your efforts will help us achieve our goals we're behind you 110%.

## Where? How Much?
We're located in Mountain View, CA but you don't have to. If you have experience working remotely, let's talk!

Competitive salary and early employee equity. 100% paid healthcare and dental coverage for you and your dependents.

## What do you want on your resume in 2021?
Startups are not for everyone. If you value fancy desks and a predictable work schedule you won't be happy here.

But if you've been looking for your big break this could be the job for you. Do you want your resume to say the following in 5 years?

> Founding team member and first marketing hire at MadKudu. Built the marketing machine that took the company from a handful of customers to $65M in revenue in 5 years. Built 15-person marketing team from scratch and managed day-to-day operations.

Better still, do you want to look back on your time at MadKudu as a special experience where you worked with other passionate people? Where you helped create a unique corporate culture? Where you hired A people and turned them into A+++ people?

If so we hope you'll [click here and apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l8Zt2AYpWklEcffrpspdgXqh5FadrXz2C7yvAQ9BCso/viewform).
