Our customers trust us with access to sensitive and valuable data to do our jobs. We take this responsibility <strong>very</strong> seriously. This document outlines our policies for being responsible stewards of this data.

## Our security philosophy

At MadKudu, we hold ourselves to a set of principles that guide every engineering and operational decision.

** We treat your data like our data **

We share our own internal business data with 3rd parties and expect them to adhere to a high level of security standards. We hold ourselves to this same level.

** We follow industry best practices **

The overwhelming majority of security issues can be avoided by following industry best practices: password policies, anti-virus software, encryption, access control. We adhere to them.

## Policy reviews

We review and update this security policy every quarter to ensure we are current with best practices.

Our last review was in **June 2017**.
The next one will be in **September 2017**.
