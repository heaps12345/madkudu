# Security policy

Our customers trust us with access to sensitive and valuable data to do our jobs. We take this responsibility <strong>very</strong> seriously. This document outlines our policies for being responsible stewards of this data.

Please send any question or comments to **[security@madkudu.com](mailto:security@madkudu.com)**.

Last update: * March 31st, 2017 *.

## Our security philosophy

At MadKudu, we hold ourselves to a set of principles that guide every engineering and operational decision.

** We treat your data like our data **

We share our own internal business data with 3rd parties and expect them to adhere to a high level of security standards. We hold ourselves to this same level.

** We follow industry best practices **

The overwhelming majority of security issues can be avoided by following industry best practices: password policies, anti-virus software, encryption, access control. We adhere to them.

## Policy reviews

We review and update this security policy every quarter to ensure we are current with best practices.

Our last review was in **March 2017**.
The next one will be in **June 2017**.

## Policy details

### Access control

Data access is controlled on a need-to-know basis based on an employee's responsibilities.

Two-factor authentication is used for all cloud services when available.

### Encryption

All data in-transit is encrypted. We use https for all web app and API calls.
SSL is used for all database queries.
All third-party credentials are encrypted at-rest and in transit.

We only store the data we need and that is already available in other systems (analytics, CRM...).
