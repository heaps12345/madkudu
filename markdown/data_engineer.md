# Data Engineer

## What you will be working on

You will be our second engineer. That's kind of a big deal. It also means that what we have in mind today could be completely different from what you will do six months today. You have to be excited by that prospect.

Here are a few of the things you might be doing:

* Move our architecture to something that can process billions of events a day (we're thinking Kakfa / Spark but that's up for grabs)
* Ultimately own the complete data pipeline
* Build new integrations to grab and analyze data from anywhere
* Automate the training of machine learning models

## Our stack

Predicting the future with data involves digging through billions of analytics events to find the needle in the haystack. So you must be into data, databases, distributed systems and machine learning.

Today we run on **node.js**, **Redshift** and **R**. We are starting to move to **Spark** and **Kafka** to keep scaling. Our entire infrastructure runs on AWS. We're into service-oriented, continuous deployment and building awesome reusable code and open-sourcing it if we can.

Think there is tech we should add to the stack? We're still super young and we need to scale that stuff fast. Bring your expertise!

## You

Things you should be excellent at (or on your way to):

* Databases technology and Big Data processing
* Expert knowledge in one programming language (JavaScript, Java, Go, Ruby, Python...)
* Managing Big Data processing over extended period of time
* Working with Data Scientists

We think this job is probably better suited for someone with some experience (4+ years) developing Big Data SaaS applications. But if you don't and think you would still do a terrific job, we'd still love to hear from you.

## Where? How Much?

We're located in **Mountain View, CA** but **you don't have to**. If you have experience working remotely, let's talk!

**Competitive salary and early employee equity**

**100% paid healthcare and dental coverage for you and your dependents**
