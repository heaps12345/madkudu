# Data Engineer

We're looking for a data engineer ready for the never-ending challenge of scaling a data architecture. You will be our second engineer, so be ready for a lot of challenges and a lot of responsibilities!

## What you will be working on

Here's a few of the challenging opportunities you could be helping us with today:

* Move our architecture to a high-throughput distributed queue and scale our platform to billions of rows of data per day
* Introduce a real-time layer to our data architecture
* Build new integrations to grab and analyze data from anywhere
* Manage entity resolution across systems to be able to get data from anywhere and send it everywhere
* Automate the training of machine learning models


## Our stack

Predicting the future with data involves digging through billions of analytics events to find the needle in the haystack. We are constantly evolving our stack to build a better needle finder, which often includes displaying our passion for algorithms, distributed systems, and machine learning. We would love it if you shared our passion and teach us some cool stuff!

Today we run on **node.js**, **Redshift** and **R**. We are starting to move some of it to **Spark** and **Kafka**. Our entire infrastructure runs on AWS. We're into service-oriented, streams, continuous deployment and building awesome reusable code and open-sourcing it if we can.

Think there is some cool tech we should add to the stack? We're still lean and mean and will remain that way to scale and adapt quickly. Bring your expertise and check your ego at the door with the rest of ours!

## You
Things you should be excellent at (or on your way to):

* Databases technology and Big Data processing
* Expert knowledge in one programming language (JavaScript, Java, Go, Ruby, Python...)
* Managing Big Data processing over extended period of time
* Working with Data Scientists

We think this job is probably better suited for someone with some experience (4+ years) developing Big Data SaaS applications. But if you don't and think you would still do a terrific job, we'd still love to hear from you.

## Where? How Much?
The company is located in **Mountain View, CA** but **you don't have to**. If you're the perfect candidate but prefer working remotely (and have experience doing so), let's talk!

** Competitive salary + early engineer equity

**100% paid health care and dental coverage for you and your dependents**
