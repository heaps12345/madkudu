# Data Engineer

## MadKudu?

At MadKudu, our mission is to make predictive analytics available to everyone. We believe that data science and machine learning will change all businesses, not just the ones who can afford it today. We are obsessed about using data to simplify complex decisions and automate tedious processes.

An awesome team with great traction
We're a small and tightly-knit founding team. We've spent years together building data systems and teams at a Sequoia-backed startup. Everyone has several years of software engineering and machine learning experience. We love building together and are looking for exceptional people to build with us.

We participated in Techstars in the summer of 2015 and raised a $1.4M seed round in 2015 from awesome investors.

We've added a dozen new customers since the beginning of the year. Early customers are loving the product and referring us to their friends. We believe we're on to something big and are looking for amazing people to grow even faster.


## Set to build a great company

As a small company, we live (and die) by our culture. At MadKudu, we are:

* [Honey badgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg)
* Obsessed with people's potential. We're obsessed with learning and consistently improving. We strive to help each team member achieve their full potential and build their dream job.
* Deliberate: We believe that deliberate practice is what makes you a world-class performer and make time for it. We also believe that deliberate hypotheses and experimentation are the fasted way to learn. In other words, you can do everything, as long as you have a hypothesis about why you're doing it.
* In it for the long haul: We keep a work/life/family balance by working smarter instead of longer. We focus on output rather than the number of hours you spend at the office.


## What you will be working on
You will be our second engineer. That's kind of a big deal. It also means that what we have in mind today could be completely different from what you will do six months today. You have to be excited by that prospect.

Here are a few of the things you might be doing:

Move our architecture to a high-throughput distributed queue and scale our platform to billions of rows of data per day
Ultimately own the complete data pipeline
Build new integrations to grab and analyze data from anywhere
Automate the training of machine learning models

## Our stack

Predicting the future with data involves digging through billions of analytics events to find the needle in the haystack. So you must be into data, databases, distributed systems and machine learning.

Today we run on node.js, Redshift and R, Redis. We are starting to move some of it to Spark and Kafka. Our entire infrastructure runs on AWS. Weâ€™re into service-oriented, streams, continuous deployment and building awesome reusable code and open-sourcing it if we can.

Think there is some cool tech we should add to the stack? We're still super young and we need to scale that stuff fast. Bring your expertise!

## You
Things you should be excellent at (or on your way to):

Databases technology and Big Data processing
Expert knowledge in one programming language (JavaScript, Java, Go, Ruby, Python...)
Managing Big Data processing over extended period of time

We think this job is probably better suited for someone with experience (5+ years) developing Big Data SaaS applications. But if you don't and think you would still do a terrific job, we'd still love to hear from you.

## Where? How Much?
The company is located in **Mountain View, CA** but you don't have to. If you're the perfect candidate but prefer working remotely (and have experience doing so), let's talk!

* [77k to 130k] salary and [0.8%-1.5%] based on your experience and choice
* 100% paid healthcare and dental coverage for you and your dependents
