## We want to help you sell more
MadKudu does intelligent lead scoring for SaaS companies using predictive analytics.

That’s a fancy way of saying we can help your sales team get more efficient using data science.

We identify your best leads based on customer fit. We tell you who is ready to buy, upsell, or cancel based on what they do in your app.

Best of all, we aggregate this insight for your sales team so they can have more enriching customer conversations.
## But you’re skeptical - so we’ll prove it
We understand. You’re interested accelerating sales with predictive analytics but you’re wondering ...

*How much incremental revenue will MadKudu create?*<br>
*How much time will this take?*<br>
*Do I have to change my sales process?*<br>
*How is MadKudu different from X, Y, or Z tool that we already use?*

During your proof of concept (POC) with MadKudu we will work with you to answer these questions. Here is what you can expect.

&nbsp;

# Step-by-step - what to expect

## Step 1: Sales acceleration consultation (30-min call)
We’ve helped **more than 100 companies** accelerate sales using data science and know where it works - and where it doesn’t. We’ll discuss your existing tools, lead volumes, and sales process to see if we’re a good match.
We only proceed if we mutually agree MadKudu is a good fit for you.

## Step 2: Connect your marketing & sales tools to MadKudu (15-min)

Most of these integrations can be made with a single click

## Step 3: Sales pipeline analysis (30-min call)
After 7 days we will have enough data to give you insight into your sales pipeline. We’ll cover topics such as:

+ Strong and weak predictors of buying, upselling, or canceling.
+ Characteristics of leads who should be managed by sales.
+ Instances where sales spent time on leads who won’t convert.
+ Qualified leads overlooked by sales.

We’ll also show you - using your CRM and your data - how your sales team can use this information accelerate sales.
