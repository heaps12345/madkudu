# How to develop on local

Install [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com/)

Add the repository to Anvil

Access the local version via [http://madkudu-website.dev/]

# Build

```
#!shell

npm install
```
# Version control

For now, commit and push directly to the master branch

# Deployment

Every push to the master branch automatically deploys the new site to namecheap.

If you want to push without deploying (to save your work remotely), use a branch and do a pull request when ready.
