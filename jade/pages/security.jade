				h1 Security Policy

				p Our customers trust us with access to sensitive and valuable data to do our jobs. We take this responsibility <strong>very</strong> seriously.
				
				p This document outlines our policies for being responsible stewards of this data. Please send any questions or comments to Paul Cothenet, MadKudu's Security Officer: paul@madkudu.com.
				
				p Last updated May 24, 2015.
				
				h2.terms-title Our security philosophy

				p Since no security policy can cover every possible scenario we hold ourselves to a set of principles. 
				
				h4.terms-title Our golden rule: we treat your data like our data
				
				p We share our own internal business data with 3rd parties and expect them to adhere to a high level of security standards. We hold ourselves to this same level. How? By asking ourselves one simple question:
				
				p <em>Suppose we were you - how would we want our data handled?</em>
				
				p Almost every situation is covered with this golden rule.
				
				h4.terms-title We retrieve and store only what we need
				
				p Storing less data saves us money, limits our exposure - and helps us sleep better.
				
				h4.terms-title We follow industry best practices
					
				p The overwhelming majority of security issues can be avoided by following industry best practices: password policies, anti-virus software, encryption, access control. We adhere to them.
				
				h4.terms-title We tell you if we think something went wrong
				
				p Mistakes happen. Bad people do bad things. Prudent companies get hacked. It could happen to you or to us.
				
				p Nobody can promise 100% security - but everyone can promise 100% transparency. So we do.

				h2.terms-title Quarterly reviews
				
				p We run a penetration test every quarter by ... ??  [[[Paul, I think we need more here.]]]
				
				p We review and update this security policy every quarter to ensure we are current with best practices.
				
				p Our next review is July 2016.  [[[Paul, you good with this? Quarterly Asana task?]]]
				
				h2.terms-title Data in-transit

				p All data in-transit is encrypted. We use https for all web-app and API calls.
				
				p SSL is used for all database queries.
				
				p Two-factor authentication is used for all cloud services when available.
				
				p All third-party credentials are encrypted.
				
				h2.terms-title Data sharing [[Paul, any additions?]]
				
				p We don't share customer data with 3rd parties without a written agreement with the exception of:
				
				ul
					li We store data on Amazon AWS S3 and Redshift.
					li We process some data on Heroku.
					li We store data on a MongoDB instance of Compose.io.
				
				h2.terms-title Data storage
				
				p No data is stored locally except as required for customer support or analysis. 
				
				[[[ Sam, we probably need more on this. Since customers will see the reports we generate do we need to say that everything is done on Google sheets? Think about the presentations we have for UXPin, Contactually ...  we should probably not have their names in these decks. We also may want to have a separate folder where we store any customer data so we can make sure access is controlled. Anyway, just think we need some more thought on this one.]]]
				
				
				p Data is immediately deleted when a customer cancels.
				
				p We only pull the data we need. For instance, we do not need SSN or credit card data.
		
				
				h2.terms-title Passwords
				
				p All passwords must conform to the following. Optional requirements are available for those customers who request them.
				
				ul
					li 12 characters minimum
					li At least 1 uppercase letter
					li At least 1 lowercase letter
					li At least 1 number
					li At least 1 non-alphanumeric character
					li (Optional) Passwords expire after 90 days.
					li (Optional) Password reuse prevention.
				
				h2.terms-title Background checks
				
				p We perform background checks on all employees hired after 5/1/2016.
				
				h2.terms-title Access control

				p Data access is controlled on a need-to-know basis based on an employee's responsibilities.

				h2.terms-title Malware and anti-virus protection

				p We install malware and anti-virus protection software whenever prudent based on the level of risk and generally accepted best practices.
				
				p Examples are [[[[??????]]]]

				h2.terms-title Access logging
				
				p MadKudu logs x, y, z, and maintains them for j days/weeks/years [[[Paul, anymore on this.]]]

				h2.terms-title Breach notifications
				
				p We will notify customers about any confirmed security or privacy breach as soon as possible. We provide assessment and mitigation reports within
				
				ul
					li 24 hours for a critical events.
					li 2 business days for non-critical events.
