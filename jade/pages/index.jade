						p You already have lots of customer data. CRM, product usage, billing, marketing, support... You name it.
						p But this data is siloed in multiple applications. And it is in a form that is hardly of any use to understand who your customers really are and what they care about.
						p MadKudu automatically brings all this data together. You now have a unified view of your customers, understand their journey and know how to improve it.
