If You are agreeing to this Agreement for use of the Service by an organization, then You are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of that organization (and "Customer," "You" and "Your" will refer to that organization). You must have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement; otherwise You must not sign up for the Service. By using the Service, You are representing and warranting that You are over the age of 18, or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence.
